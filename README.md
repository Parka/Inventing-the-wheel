# Inventing-the-wheel
Just a silly game/toy for honing my Godot development skills.

How to play:

For cutting click/touch outside the wheel, drag through it and release.
Once you are happy with the wheel, press the V button to release
Check how far you get!
I've only tested the windows version so far, let me know if you find any issue.
